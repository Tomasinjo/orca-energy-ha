### How to install dashboards:

1. Install [mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card) and [mushroom cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/tree/main)


2. Restart Home Assistant

3. In Home Assistant, go to Overview, click pencil at top right corner and click tripple dots. Select "Raw configuration editor".

Scroll down to bottom and paste either English or Slovenian version. It will appear as tab "Orca".

NOTE: The dashboard only supports single heating circuit. If you use two (e.g. floor + radiator heating), then you will have to add those entities manually.
